## Hardware

### School Laptop

- Intel i3 10110U 2.10 GHz (Turbo up to 4.10 GHz);
- 8 GB of RAM (single channel üòî);
- 128 GB SDD (no cache üò™);
- Full HD IPS Display (it's good enoguh but has some dead pixels üòê);

Came with Windows 10 Pro Edu when I got it back in 2022. Since at the end of 2023 I have installed Windows 11 Pro which automatically updated to Pro Edu. I've removed all the bloatware and ran WinUtil to reduce RAM usage and set Windows Update for Security only, since then it's been actually great, it even runs smoothly with transparency at a zoom level of 100% (the default is 150%).

### Smartphone

- Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE (long name I know);
- 128 GB/8 GB model;
- Snapdragon 778G;
- Currently with a 1 SIM, 1 SD Card (64 GB) setup;

Came with MIUI 12 by default, since then I probably had more than 30 custom ROMs flashed onto it. Currently running HyperOS China Stable port, rooted and minimal debloated, also comes with AOSP installer instead of the horrendous Xiaomi one. I've also set a custom NextDNS profile for it to block trackers (mainly from Google and Xiaomi).
My most used apps are on the [mobile software section](#android) if you want to know about it.

## Software

### Windows

- Browsers: Firefox (main), Vivaldi (main before May of 2024), Arc (school only)
  **Extensions:**
- Bitwarden
- uBlock Origin
- Sidebery for tabs on the side (similar to Vivaldi and Arc but better üëå)
- Unhook
- SponsorBlock
- Return YouTube Dislike

---

- Code Editor(s) & IDE(s): Visual Studio Code
- Other coding stuff:
  - Python
  - Windows Terminal
  - Git and GitHub Cli
  - Docker Desktop
  - WSL
- Customization:
  - PowerToys
  - WinToys
  - AltSnap
- Office 365
- paint.net (but my main design tool is Figma)

### Android

- Browser: Brave (I had Firefox before but unfortunately is not as fast)
- System utilities:
  - Battery Guru (to check battery health and stats)
  - App Manager (one of the best apps for a rooted android phone)
- Poweramp (music player with support for Hi-Res)
- Shazam
- YouTube Revanced eXtended (normal revanced is really finicky to install and does not work on microG rooted devices without installing GMS)
- ZArchiver (proper file manager)
- AudioRelay (since the audio card on my laptop died üòî)
- Magisk Modules
  - Viper4Android (transforms a nugget earphone into a _beast_)

### Services

This are web services that I use, they are most likely installed on both my laptop and mobile so that's why they are not included in the lists above.

- Figma (for design)
- Bitwarden (password manager)
- Mega (cloud storage - E2EE)
- Obsidian (with Mega for sync)
