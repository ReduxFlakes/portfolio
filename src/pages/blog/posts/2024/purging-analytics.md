description: The reason(s) why the removal of telemetry on this website
---

Throughout most of this website lifetime I had analytics, the main reason behind it was that I really wanted to know what people were most interested in, what posts had more traction, what was my most visited page, what projects got more clicks, etc. Now, I'm a privacy advocate but I do believe that some kind of telemetry does help in the development of projects (KDE and Fedora being an example) and guide them in a better direction, but with the web beginning to rotten (mainly because of corporation destroying it) and the increased use of AdBlocks, I don't really see the point of having any kind of telemetry because:

1. The AdBlock usage increase makes telemetry useless since... well, AdBlock's block telemetry;
2. I don't remember the last time I checked GoatCounter to see how many views my website got yesterday.

Another reason is that my website is hosted on Neocities and Neocities actually shows how many views and hits my website has, and yes, even though it's not accurate, since it's server side, the information I get is closer to the truth than GoatCounter's with the bonus of not having to ship extra JS to the client!

Now I got this idea from a [blog post](https://ericmurphy.xyz/blog/no-analytics/) by Eric Murphy where he talks about the reason why he removed analytics from his website with the main reason being that when you have a website that is dedicated to technical topics related to tech (ex: programming, privacy, security, web) your readers most likely have ad blockers which then goes to my point of analytics being useless.
