title: I've moved back to Windows 10

Today I made the decision to move back to Windows 10 on my laptop after using Windows 11 for some 2~3 months, the reason? Tired of the taskbar.

Now, I'm not angry because it's centered or because I miss the action center and so on, the real reason is that I miss the ability to add toolbars, especially because my old setup on Windows 10 had the QuickLaunch toolbar to open programs, similar to how it was on Windows 95 - Vista, since I was a heavy user of Windows XP and Vista back when I was young, and so it made more sense to have that setup/workflow.

For people that do not understand what I'm talking about, I've put an example below showing how it looks like.

You could say that there's programs that can bring that feature back, and you're right, until this last week I was using [StartAllBack](https://www.startallback.com/) which brings back a lot of the old UI to Windows 11, like full option menus by default, and the old taskbar with the toolbar feature. However that program is paid and so the rational reason was to move to Winows 10 where that feature is free, FOREVER.

There's also the small reason that Windows 11 was consuming 200~300MB even after debloat, compared to Window 10, but that never ruined my experince so to speak.

Might go back when Windows 10 finally _dies_.

See you soon!
