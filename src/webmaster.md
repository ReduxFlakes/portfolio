Hi, my name is ReduxFlakes or reducc to close friends. I'm a computer scince student from Portugal with a pasion for old computers and vintage software (mostly from 1983 to 2007). I'm a _sucker_ for old web design especially from the 2000's with everything full of gloss, gradients, and icons.

I've been making websites since 2021 and I just joined NeoCities this year (2023).

I hope you enjoy my work as much has I love your visit!
