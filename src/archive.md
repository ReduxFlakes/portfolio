To be honest, I don't really know why I created this page. I mean, I know what it is, but I don't yet know how I'm going to proceed with it.

For the last few years, I've done a lot of stuff, from design to coding projects. Most of them are gone or lost. Some of the ones I remember were a web browser I was making back in 2021/2022 for Android; the project never got a stable footing since I had school and tests, so I couldn't really focus on that. For the design part, back then I really liked creating logos and photo edits, which I still like to do but not at the same frequency. Those logos are also lost in time or probably forever, so this page is more for keeping my hopes high on trying to find that stuff I did back then that is now lost.
