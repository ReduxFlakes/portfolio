This website uses GoatCounter as a way to count readers and see what browsers they use so that I can see how well the website is doing and if there's any issues with any browser. I don't really get paid by how many users visit my website but I like to know what my readers are interested in reading.

## Collected information

- Unique visitors - Tracks a unique reader for up to 8 hours (IP is anonymized by GoatCounter).
- Referer header - Where the reader comes from (ex. they came from the Neocities browse page).
- User-Agent - Browser identifier (ex. Windows 11 x64 Firefox Beta 120.0.1).
- Size - Screen size (ex. Smartphone Screen - 420px).

The data is saved for 31 days (since that's the lowest I can set on GoatCounter),

I do not collect country, region, and language since I don't care about those. This data is also anonymized and I do not know your IP. I also do not collect any personal information since it's useless to me and there's not really a way to do so.

If you are curious you can see the dashboard in real time at: [https://reduxflakes.goatcounter.com/](https://reduxflakes.goatcounter.com/).
