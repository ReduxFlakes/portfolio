In the past few years I've designed a lot of stuff, from logos, to websites. On this page you can find some of that work, these include OSM (Operating System mockups), buttons, and logos for projects.

> Please note: when you want to use any of the content here, save them to your site instead of hotlinking, I don't want to break your website because of a silly change and I don't want you to affect my bandwidth. Also please credit if you use any of the content below (not needed for buttons)! Thank you! - Redux
