Yes you heard that right, I have finally updated this place! Like the new design? Probably not... It's minimal but not beautiful, however that might change when I get this update complete, since it's still missing some content, pages, and other fun stuff.

However, different from my old websites, this one will receive weekly updates (if I'm able to). There's new pages to explore even though there's still a lack of content.

I got a [bookmarks page](/bookmarks) now, and I finally have a nice website button which you can find on the sidebar, if you really like me (probably not me but anyways).

In the next couple of days I will try to add new stuff, most of which are written in the todo list found on the sidebar, and I'm also gonna try to improve and build upon the design a little bit so that it doesn't look this bad.

If you are interested, check the website timeline in the [about page](/about#backstory%2Ftimeline) to see how this website always stayed dry (ðŸ˜©), anyways, I hope you like the new website, have a nice day! ðŸ˜Š
