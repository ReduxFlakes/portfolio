In the past few years I've designed a lot of stuff, from logos, to websites. On this page you can find some of that work, these include OSM (Operating System mockups), buttons, and logos for projects.

> Please note: when you want to use any of the content here, save them to your site instead of hotlinking, I don't want to break your website because of a silly change and I don't want you to affect my bandwidth. Also please credit if you use any of the content below (not needed for buttons)! Thank you! - Redux

My own website button! Inspired by the green color scheme, blurred website logo on the background pared with the iconic Helvetica font! Use it if you want to share my website.
