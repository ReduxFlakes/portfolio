## Hardware

### School Laptop

- Intel i3 10110U 2.10 GHz (Turbo up to 4.10 GHz);
- 8 GB of RAM (single channel üòî);
- 128 GB SDD (no cache üò™);
- Full HD IPS Display (it's good enoguh but has some dead pixels üòê);

Came with Windows 10 Pro Edu when I got it back in 2021~2. Since then I have installed Windows 11 Pro.
I've removed all the bloatware and ran WinUtil to reduce RAM usage and set Windows Update for Security only. It's been great, it even runs smoothly with transparency at a zoom level of 100% (the default is 150%).

### Smartphone

- Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE;
- 128 GB/8 GB model;
- Snapdragon 778G;
- Currently with a 1 SIM, 1 SD Card (64 GB) setup;
- [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) 21

Came with MIUI 12 by default, since then I probably had more than 30 custom ROMs flashed onto it. ~~Currently running HyperOS China Stable port, rooted and minimal debloated, also comes with AOSP installer instead of the horrendous Xiaomi one. I've also set a custom NextDNS profile for it to block trackers (mainly from Google and Xiaomi).~~

~~I've now switched to Pixel OS and debloated some of the Google apps and services that I do not use.~~

[I've switched AGAIN!](/blog/posts/2024/going-back-to-lineageos/)

My most used apps are on the [mobile software](#android) section if you want to know about it.
