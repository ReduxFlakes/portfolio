Hi, my name is ReduxFlakes (or reducc for close friends). I'm a computer science student that does web and sometimes Android development.

I'm mostly known on the Off The Road Discord community and also on Neocities, where I have my biggest project, [SurfScape](https://surfscape.neocities.org/) (and this website ðŸ˜Š).

While I mostly do web related stuff with [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), I've been branching out more and have recently started learning [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), TypeScript, and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

In the beggining I started out with Android app development with Java back in 2022. Even though I took a break, I've since started learning Koltin which led me to explore Jetpack Compose and I'm loving it!

On a personal note, I'm a very shy and introvert person who loves tech.
When I'm not coding or procrastinating I mostly delve into music or designing. I do mockups sometimes when I want to and I also have a small collection of Vinyl (check my [music page](https://www.last.fm/user/ReduxFlakes) to learn more about my music taste).

So that's it, this is my small introduction of me (mosly on the programming side though), anyways have a nice day! ðŸ¤—
