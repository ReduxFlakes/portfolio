The purpose of this page is to show a timeline of the construction of the site, how it's build, and respective credits for things I've used on it not built by me.

## Backstory/Timeline

The first release of this website dates back to 2021 when I wasn't even aware of NeoCities and the fandom behind the old web. The real reason of starting a personal site was to share my projects and learn HTML. Unfortunately I don't have any archives of sites I made back then but imagine like this: a website with white background, black text, Arial font and the entire site was centered (including text) without any breakpoints. Yeah, It was pretty bad since I didn't know CSS.

Skipping some months when I got some grasp on CSS I built, let's say, a 2nd generation of my site and by the way, the website was hosted using GitHub Pages! I don't really remembered how it was since at that time I was more of experimenting with CSS rather than building a real personal site.

### 2022

In 2022 I decided to go more professional, I even got a custom domain which was `reduxflakes.ga` and was still hosted using GitHub Pages. Now at this time I was on fire, every month the site had a completly different design which means I will divide this year in the months where a redesign happened. Keep in mind there were a lot more designs which never got released and since it's more than 10 screenshots I will only show major releases.

#### August

#### September

The September website was the one that I was actually proud, it was built using Astro 1.0 and was heavely inspired by [kdrag0n.dev](https://kdrag0n.dev/) website with the only difference being the blog page. I don't have any archives and the only screenshot I have is when I was developing the posts card on the blog page.

#### December

In December I decided to redesign the site to be more simple and create more content for it (I also moved to Jekyll), that is also when I started using Mastodon a lot more and since I'm on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/) and I follow one of the project managers being [Kev Quirk](https://kevquirk.com/) I got the inspiration of his minimal site and since he has a CSS framework called [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) I got inspired into also recreating that. Even though I haven't archived that site I did made a lot of development logs on my Discord server so I have some prints to show how it looked! üòä

### 2023

#### January

2023 is interesting... So some people might know me from the SurfScape project which at the time was dead and was still called NetFind. So you might be thinking, why are you talking about this? Well I had the idea to revice it into a personal site, however I still built a new iteration of the site before that. This version was going to be hosted on GitHub but after a few days I abandoned the idea. Since I used Linux, I had the idea to add a little terminal with neofetch to show some information about me, similar to the old site which this one was built on top off.

It even had a download and archive page!

{% figure "/static/images/personal/website-timeline/website_beta_jan_2023_2.webp", "Downloads section - January 2023" %}

At this time I was already aware of NeoCities and was watching it's community for like a month to see how it worked and if it was suitable for creating the next iteration of my site, and so that's what I did, created an account and started building the next site with the idea I had at the start of the year. The main reason behind my move was [OpenBooks]()
I joined their server and I really enjoyed the idea behind personal sites and the old web aesthetics, afterall I love old tech!

So I picked up NetFind and made it online again on NeoCities, and then created eversoul. The reason behind the name was because since it was a personal site I wanted a name that conveyed that so that's why I chose eversoul, another reason is what I talked about earlier, this site was originated from the old NetFind and that was a web portal and so I decided to create a different name for my site to show people that it was more than a simple personal site.

{% figure "/static/images/personal/website-timeline/eversoul_jan_2023.webp", "Development screenshot of eversoul - January 2023" %}

As you can see, I was really into pixel art, and I even added a CRT-like animation to it! Now keep in mind this website did evolve a lot more that it seems on the screenshot, there was a time I had a theme engine with 3 different themes for the site, one was inspired by the Luna theme from Windows XP!

#### February

In February I finally decided to "kill off" NetFind and combine both eversoul and the rest of NetFind into the same site. The name was still the same with the only difference being that it starts with a capital letter and the text is italic like this: _Eversoul_. Fortunately I did [archive the site to Archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20230215201839/https://eversoul.neocities.org/).

{% figure "/static/images/personal/website-timeline/eversoul_feb_2023.webp", "Development screenshot of eversoul - January 2023" %}

#### March

In March I decided to change the name of Eversoul again and to what? Well, I changed it to NetFind again. I will not gonna talk about it a lot since it's not really related to this site.

#### April

NetFind finally released as a beta with a new design aesthetic since after changing the name to NetFind the design remained the same.

However I did come back with my personal website, this is possibly the biggest overhaul ever since it stayed quite updated. I decided to go with a minimal design this time but still having some pixel art around from eversoul.

I have made [archives to archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20230424185047/https://reduxflakes.neocities.org/) for anyone interested at the time!

#### May

At the end of May I decided to go all minimal after seing [Bradley Taunt](https://bt.ht/) old website. But even then I wasn't sure about it.

[Archive of the site](https://web.archive.org/web/20230531144916/https://reduxflakes.neocities.org/).

#### October

After some months of inactivity since I was working on SurfScape and had a vacation, in October I finally decided to pick up my website again, same with the last one, I decided go minimalist but with some changes on the design to make it, let's say, more modern.

#### December - Today

And we've reached the end! Yeah as you can see this website has quite some "history", I also hope that the current version will stay the same as in, no major redesigns, there will always be small fixes and improvements but if I decide to redesign, the current site will be archived but I hope that doesn't happen.
