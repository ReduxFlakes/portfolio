# an update

It's been a long time since I've actually worked on this site releasing content and showcasing the things I love, unfortunately time doesn't stop and it's really easy to waste it. I am happy that I have been improving my mental health and trying to improve myself though, that means focusing more on a single project than jumping from on to another as I've been doing for the past 2 years.

It will be hard but I already have a file on Obsidian with content ideas for this place.

About SurfScape, that has received some love on the past-past week but the new features I want to reveal are still half-way baked, the source code is also somewhat a mess but I'll try to figure out a way on how to keep it clean!

If you've been wondering what I have been doing this year, well you can check [Mockupedia](mockupedia.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page) where I've been posting my latest mockups from an ATL of Microsoft called [CompuSoft](mockupedia.miraheze.org/wiki/CompuSoft) and another project of mine called [Aurora Systems International](mockupedia.miraheze.org/wiki/Aurora_Systems_International).

This is all everyone, the navbar probably contains broken links but that will be fix... eventually...

Well thanks for checking my site I guess, have a nice day!
