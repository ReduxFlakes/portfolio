In the past few years I've designed a lot of stuff, from logos, to websites. On this page you can find some of that work, these include mostly buttons and simple website layouts for anyone, but it's focused on NeoCitizens. :3

> Please, when you want to use any of the buttons, save them to your site instead of hotlinking, I don't want to break your website because of something breaking, thank you. - Redux

Made this button for the [DreamProject Legacy](https://dreamproject98.com/index.html) website, since the official one is not 88x31. The font used is Cutive Mono.

The new button that will be used on SurfScape for anything related to the Community (Retro Space). It was inspired by "The Network Neighborhood".

My own button! It's kinda random, I didn't want to just put my name on it, so I decided to add AIM Messenger logo because of it's connection with old tech.
