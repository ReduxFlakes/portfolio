As a privacy advocate myself, I take privacy pretty seriously. This website uses GoatCounter as a way to count users and see what browser they use so that I can see how well the website is doing. Even though I don't really get paid by how many users visit my website, I do take up a lot of my time to build it and if nobody is interested I can then use my time on other things that are more important.

A basic rundown of the information I collect is as follows:

- Unique visitors - Tracks a unique user for up to 8 hours.
- Referer header - Where the user comes from in terms of source (ex. they came from the NeoCities browse page).
- User-Agent - Browser identifier (ex. Windows 11 x64 Firefox Beta 120.0.1).
- Size - Screen size (ex. Smartphone Screen - 420px).
- Language - Language that the browser has by default.

I do not collect what country or region users are from. This data is also anonymized and I do not know any of the user's IPs. I also do not collect any personal information since it's useless to me and there's not really a way to do so.
